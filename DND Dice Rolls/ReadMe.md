# DND Dice Rolls

In 2025, after watching a DND Podcast I wanted to make my own DND character and
run a campaign against myself. The point of it was to make my story about
Belle the Half-Fairy and her battle encounters have stakes.

I couldn't just let her win every fight because otherwise that'd get old fast. I want to
know who gets hurt and how much.

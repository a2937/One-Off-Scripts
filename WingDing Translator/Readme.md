# WingDing Translator

In 2015, Undertale was released. It was a really wonderful game and had hundreds 
of fans. It's now a social pheneonmon with even a Pope having recieved a copy
as a gift.

However there was one oddity in the game that people took too. In a certain room, 
there's a deformed skeleton and WingDings pop up on screen. That's the character's
quirk, each skeleton talks in a goofy font. 

Unlike Papyrus or even Comic Sans, WingDings is very hard to read. Especially these 
days where it's Unicode characters and not just a matter of changing the font back
to something easy to read. 

While I could just use a normal translator like those on LingoJam, I have to keep a
tab open and it's a little too distracting. 

In this folder is a chart is demonstrate how to translate these symbols by hand.

To run this script, install it with TamperMonkey (or any other script modifier).

NOTE: Eventually I will replace that hard to read chart with a better one.
